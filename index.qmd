## JSON

JOSN (JavaScript Object Notation) is to all intents and purposes the equivalent of lists in R; a flexible data format that can store pretty much anything-except data.frames, a structure that does not exist in JavaScript.

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

lst <- list(
  a = 1,
  b = list(
    c = c("A", "B")
  ),
  d= 1:5
)

toJSON(lst, pretty = TRUE)

toJSON(lst)
```

Set `pretty` to `TRUE` to add indentation for cleaner printing, but this is an augument you should omit when writing production code; it will reduce the file size (fewer spaces = smaller file size).
